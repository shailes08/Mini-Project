        You put a lot of work into creating your website, so it certainly makes sense that you’d want to protect it from
        content thieves and duplicators. That urge might have driven you to wonder, “how do I copyright my website?” And
        what about all of the individual elements on the site? It would definitely make sense to know how to copyright a
        logo or a blog post.
